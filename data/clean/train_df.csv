For most of them, passion and longing flames briefly from amidst the modest wreckage and ordinary accidents of their lives. For them, passion is a lyrical wondering about the difficulty of things, and about the modest consolations that recognising this difficulty brings."

Its function is basically to cover a woman's hair and hide the shape of her breasts but it can be worn in a variety of ways, draped round the top half of her body and head, folded over her chest and hanging over her shoulders or loosely placed round her neck. The way she wears it shows to the righteous and inquisitive observers always present in Asian communities just how modest she is."

Since tort damages would be reduced by these benefits, resort to tort recovery by the victim is largely discouraged except in cases of severe injury when it might be worth his while to pursue damages for non-economic loss or, in the case of high income earners, for the excess income loss. Therefore the higher the scale of benefits and the more modest the prevailing tariff for non-pecuniary tort damages, the more tort liability is elbowed out by social insurance."

The doom and gloom of the retail sector was echoed by Coloroll, which blamed interest rates for halving its profits to #10m and putting 450 people out of work, and by Burton which had the City hurriedly downgrading expectations for next year following the announcement of a modest 6 per cent rise in 1988-89 profits."

For example the sport of crown green bowling, which was very little known outside of the north of England, has been shown to a wider public; the greens are often oddly bereft of spectators, and the northern accents of the players are plainly audible as they urge on their woods or confer solemnly as a pair over the last bowl of an important `end"".

And once again it was dynamic Martin Dugard who was the star of the show with some brilliant speedway, none more so than the last heat victory that settled the issue for Oxford. Dugard, one of three Oxford riders left in the world championship chase, again gave his all and the two scraps he had with home favourite and equally promising youngster Mark Loram were memorable to say the least."

Pandya, the national junior champion, who made a promising international debut against South Korea last month, went down 12-15, 15-11, 15-8 to Miles Johnson, a controversial choice for Auckland."
8271,promise-a,801045,promising,537614,"This is now the fourth change in the side beaten last weekend by the North and potentially the one that severely reduces their chances of bucking the trend.

In the end all three major participants Nashwan, Indian Skimmer and Warning, came under starter's orders after each in turn during the five days prior to the race had at one stage or another appeared a doubtful runner. So seldom in racing do these promised clashes of the giants materialise that Saturday's race proved an outstanding exception."

8274,promise-a,801059,promising,537614,"Andrew showed Gloucester how the wind should have been used early on in the second half and, with Mark Bailey's irresistible running again raising the question of his ridiculous under-use by England, the atmosphere soon changed from competitive league game to Wasps exhibition.  Bailey galloped in for three tries and made a fourth &dash. the best of the game -turning a break from the 22 by the promising Steve Pilgrim into a surge down the middle and then slipping the ball out to Simon Smith."

There are moments of grace and humour in the new film, but in the absence of an underlying architecture they are wasted. Beineix introduces promising characters &dash. a muscleman who resents the young couple and supplies dangerous animals, a German tiger tamer at the Munich circus who makes life difficult for them &dash. then drops them with perverse lack of drama."

The programme is networked (transmission times vary across the regions) and is aimed fairly squarely at the late-night, couch potato and pub spill-over crowd. It does not look to be breaking much new ground: the preview trailer included items on the massively under-hyped Batman, scoop interviews with Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck, both on the promo trail for their new film The Old Gringo, and a promised itemette on newcomer Kylie Minogue."

Gradually the lead was whittled down to a mere four points as the try-scoring of Swarz and the accuracy of Jaco Coetzee with the boot had the Welsh management checking their watches.

It pledged the signatories to accept arbitration in international disputes ; pledged them also to disarm by agreement. In return they exchanged promises of mutual support in case of unprovoked aggression."
8661,promise-n,800859,promise,537566,"There was also disappointment that no immediate action had followed such strong words, and lack of comprehension that Hitler needed any further powers to be granted.  Further disappointment arose from Hitler's promise of retaliation for the bombing of German cities, when, in the days that followed, only English towns such as Bath, Norwich, and York were reported as bombed."
8662,promise-n,800861,promise,537573,"The structure and imagery of Invisible Cities are immensely suggestive, perhaps dangerously so.  The psychedelic, yet powerfully intellectualised descriptions seem to cry out for post-Ligetian orchestral treatment, and the 11 x 5 cities, arranged in nine sections, hold out the promise of a structure at once complex and rigorous."

Only a fundamental improvement in the military situation, the implementation of drastic retaliation against Britain, and the creation of an effective defence against allied bombing &dash. a decisive transformation in war fortunes, in other words &dash. could have refurbished Hitler's tarnished popularity. In fact, however, new disappointments followed on Hitler's confident promises: the bombing, almost unimpeded by German defences, intensified; the situation on the eastern Front worsened almost by the day; and in the west an invasion was expected at any time."
8665,promise-n,800867,promise,537573,"The single hydraulic pump was always one of the Apache's less attractive features because, if the left-hand engine failed after take-off, you had to operate the emergency handpump to raise the wheels at a time when it is essential to clean up the airframe without delay.  Seen on the ground the Piper Apache is a chubby little bird, somewhat dated and rather sedate looking in comparison with its younger cousin, the Twin Comanche, but there is an impression of dependability and a promise of comfort."
8666,promise-n,800871,promise,538409,"Traditional practices were to be restored at the end of the war; this promise was kept, to everyone's surprise.  Profits were to be restricted, in exchange for the sacrifice of union rights ; this promise, too, was kept, though less effectively than the unions expected. Finally, the unions were to share in the direction of industry through local joint committees; this promise was not kept &dash. the committees were used only to organize dilution."

8668,promise-n,800873,promise,537626,"Between 1950 and 1961, the NFFC helped into production almost half the 730 British first feature films produced.  The second government measure increased producers' bargaining power with financiers by reserving for British films a portion of the money taken at the domestic box office. Although the returns accruing to a particular film from the Eady Levy, as it was called, were limited both by the size of the box office in any particular year, and that film's success in the market-place (the levy was paid out in proportion to a film's success), the promise it offered did make it easier for independents to raise cash."

Paul Dugard has scored an amazing 16 maximums this season in the SL 2, but his top score in the top flight was six at home to Reading.

As the minutes of silence and confusion unfolded, the crush eased and a visibly shaken band were allowed back onstage.

The job he most wanted was at Manchester United, but no call came from Old Trafford's lame-duck chairman, Martin Edwards, who has committed himself to Alex Ferguson while awaiting an acceptable offer for his controlling interest in the club.

Despite the roar of fireworks and the orchestrated flag-waving, the aristocratic Mr Collor's memorable eight-minute speech is a mere interlude for the more than 50,000 people gathered in front of Salvador's old fort and lighthouse. Mr Collor, whom recent polls gave a 10-point lead over his nearest adversary, Luis Inacio da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party, repeats his vague promise to transform Brazil into a dignified country."

The party leadership has already signalled a new flexibility since the 1989 conference by including in last month's policy review a promise that the party will now consider a system other than first-past-the-post for the election of the European Parliament, for Labour's proposed new second chamber, and for its proposed regional assemblies, including the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments."

Spokespersons for two of the main opposition groups, New Forum and Democratic Awakening, welcomed the proposals but said they would have to look closely to see if there were any conditions attached.

But the Bug's nose, its infantile tininess combining with its monstrous promise, was at the moment one of her nicest features, and the best thing about it was what it shared with all babies' noses: not the gargoylian turn of its wings, which was from Patty's parents, nor the palpable bump at the bridge, which might at puberty bulk itself into a `Beal Breakfront,"" as those who had married into my mother's family, the Beals, had called it among themselves Lor several generations &dash. no, what was finest about the Bug's nose was the same amazing thing I had noticed at age five when shown a neighbor's newborn: it was so clean inside."

For the more than 300 million people likely to vote on three separate days of polling this week, the crucial issues seem to revolve around twin questions of trust.

My own opinion is that this is only possible in the light of the understanding of God given us in Jesus Christ, a God who shares our condition to the uttermost and yet who in the Resurrection has given us the possibility and promise of an ultimate glory for all things."
8904,promise-n,801715,promises,537566,"China maintains the same professed intentions.  The Basic Law will still be enacted, promising a panoply of rights and freedoms for 50 years beyond 1997. But the Chinese Constitution contains all sorts of promises, too &dash. so many that it could probably have been construed to forbid the People's Liberation Army from shooting dead hundreds of unarmed civilians, and to prohibit the arbitrary arrest, summary trial or execution of thousands more."
8905,promise-n,801716,promise,538409,"The Broadcasting Standards Council, which will be placed on a statutory footing under the Bill, was a `ridiculous"" body, Mr Hattersley said.  `It has no effective powers and no real purpose, except to pretend to keep a promise which the Prime Minister gave in an unguarded moment."""

The hit of the evening was MacMillan's first ballet, Somnambulism, which at once made clear his immense promise."
8907,promise-n,801721,promises,537566,"It cannot be learnt from experience, and so must be something with which we are innately endowed.  Locke obviously recognized the implausibility of supposing that experience gives us these pieces of knowledge; experience cannot account for their certain applicability to all wholes, all numbers, or all promises."
8908,promise-n,801726,promises,537566,"Officials added, however, that Argentina should lift its embargo on trade and air and sea links, as Britain had.  Mr Menem stressed that Argentines were still `totally convinced the islands are ours,"" and that this apparent sharp shift from the nationalist promises of his election campaign did not imply his new Peronist government was willing to set aside the country's claim to the islands."
8909,promise-n,801735,promise,537566,"He smoked heavily and without the slightest pang of guilt.  He was the best of company and entertained his many friends with generosity. Freeman contested Hartlepool in the February General Election of 1974; he was asked, and agreed, to contest Hartlepool again for the October election that year, and stuck to that promise despite being offered a safe Conservative seat a few days later."

Labour is certain to retain its commitment to spend more on the health service with a promise to restore the resources to the hospital sector it has lost in real terms since being in office.
8912,promise-n,801741,promise,537566,"But once the State settles to the task of development, the majority of people may find conditions distant from the rhetorical promise of independence.  Class struggle emerges from the supposed common interest, and the invitation to sacrifice for the nation is directed by one class at another. Ultimately, the government says, all will benefit from development, but that is a remote promise for the present generation."

Contractual relations that are dependent on personal intention and promises of certain kinds of pious behavior in return for some form of saintly baraka are one of the very few acts and contracts men can independently initiate."

8922,promise-n,801765,promise,537566,"Sir:  The pledge to readers made by the editors of Britain's national newspapers is truly impressive and perhaps long overdue.

8929,promise-n,801785,promise,537566,"But from where I stand, it is the wider issue of transparency that really counts.  We can for instance, endlessly discuss the need to maintain and reinforce brands, now that the service promise bound up with them has become so important."

By the end of the 80-minute event, the high level of mechanical decimation had intervened to ensure that survivors were well spaced out round the circuit. In third place, despite a pit stop to change tyres, Alessandro Nannini demonstrated that the new Benetton-Ford B189 has very real promise, while Nelson Piquet produced the most respectable drive of an otherwise lacklustre season, saving Lotus at the eleventh hour from the danger of being required to pre-qualify in the second half of this season."

8946,promise-n,801850,promise,537566,"Rosa Luxemberg made no concessions.  When the disputed questions were put to the practical test of revolution in 1917, she saw the `doctrinaire obstinacy"" of the Bolsheviks on the national question as one of the key factors in the disintegration of the Tsarist empire in 1918. The bourgeoisies of the Russian dependencies of Finland, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania and the other Baltic States were able to exploit the Bolshevik promise of national independence to ally with Germany against Soviet Russia."

His forwards also found some modest co-ordination, driving downfield a number of times before setting their backs free. But, as with the Services, basic skills with a greasy ball were inadequate to fulfil the promise with which they occasionally set out."
8950,promise-n,801864,promise,538411,"That is why they coexist, and one has the power to promise if and only if one has the right to do so.  The right to make a particular promise (e.g., to visit my aunt next weekend) is a derivative right of the general right to promise.

There were plenty of promises of big money, fame, glamour, fast cars and all the trappings that any actor might lust towards."

It is always up to him to waive his right under the promise and thus terminate the binding force of the promise. It is this general interest which explains why every promise, and not only those performance of which is to the specific advantage of the promisee, creates a right in the promisee."

8962,promise-n,801924,promise,537566,"It may also be that there is a limitless number of possible candidates for a form which need to be ruled out, and so we never could come to a single end of exclusion and rejection.

8965,promise-n,801931,promises,537566,Finally these examples in which to consent is to promise refute the suggestion that in one case the purpose is to confer rights and in the other to undertake an obligation.  Promising differs from consenting in two respects. Both establish promises to be a special case of consent.
8966,promise-n,801938,promise,537566,"Of course, he might lose interest in the specific content of some promises, and keeping some of them may even work against his overall interest.

Differential movements between the facing and the backing brickwork can be better accommodated by the tolerance of bending or rotation which is a quality of the metal ties that were universally adopted when the shortcomings of bonding bricks became apparent. However, the type of tie which was almost invariably used &dash. namely the galvanised steel wire `butterfly"" tie &dash. is intrinsically flimsy and lacks the long-term corrosion resistance promised by its galvanised finish (Fig 22)."

9163,promise-v,800280,promise,537527,The condition is an act of the promisor and his obligation is conditional on his action because it is desirable that he should be able to bind himself if he so wishes.  It follows that people's interest in being able to bind themselves is the basis of a power to promise which they possess and of an obligation to keep promises they make. But neither the power nor the obligation point to a right to promise.

The choice for the electorate of 82 million was commendably clear: on the centre right, Fernando Collor de Mello, a charismatic sprig of the elite oligarchy committed to opening up the economy, reducing state intervention and fighting corruption; on the left, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a bearded trade unionist promising land reform, a fairer distribution of wealth, and strong central planning."

The Tories at the 1979 general election promised that industrial action in essential services would be restricted, but a subsequent green paper killed the idea, saying that existing legal provisions, such as the 1875 Conspiracy Act, had been little used and that workers in most key industries had exercised restraint, and pleading difficulties in defining the relevant groups of workers."

Designed by John Gunter with evocative lighting by Paul Pyant, this moonlit garden scene has neoclassical pavilions of Mars and Venus on either side of the stage below looming cypresses, a little mound of butcher's grass like an overgrown flowerbed set in flagstones at the front, and way upstage a distant view of Aguas frescas, Count Almaviva's mansion, nestling like Glyndebourne itself under a hilly horizon with lights burning in its windows.

9224,promise-v,800377,promise,537527,"(Again I avoid examining the way these duties are qualified.)  Violation of the duty not to interfere with a person's promising will frustrate his right to promise and the interest on which it is base, either by preventing the person from exercising his rights or by perverting the considerations on which he decides whether to promise or not. The fact that such interferences with the right are infrequent is reflected by the fact that the right to promise is rarely invoked in ordinary practical discourse."

Indeed, because his father was scorned by his mother, because his father was a ruined cocaine addict, the Marshal was forced to feel that everyone found him unworthy. By leading him to the altar of television, you will be consecrating his loss and promising him redemption from his unworthiness."""

In spite of the setback on the defence spending vote, Mr Kinnock later scored a further advance with the results of the national executive elections, which saw Ken Livingstone replaced by John Prescott, the party's robust transport spokesman. AS SOME 3,000 East German would-be emigrants poured into West Germany's embassy in Prague yesterday, the East Germans, apparently furious at the latest development, accused West Germany of `gross breach of trust"", claiming that Bonn had promised to stop the flow."

There are times when making a certain promise (say to look after a friend's child if the friend dies before the child comes of age) are morally worthwhile but where one does not have an obligation to make them (remember that in this example too one may find other adequate ways to help one's friend).

After a couple of summers which have seen the passport queue at London's Petty France office stretch beyond three months, travellers were hoping that the Home Office might soon start action.

The architect, Roy Toms, of the Waverly District Council, was worried about what could have been an unsympathetic alteration to a venerable building, but a visit to St Martin's, Dorking, another Woodyer church, confirmed that its architect had adopted raking parapets to terminate the aisle roofs there, and the discovery of this period precedent vindicated the use of this treatment at St James Court. The original suspended wooden ground floor was entirely removed after penetration of this structure for the installation of the new cross-walls and their foundations showed that some residual sections were badly affected by woodworm."
